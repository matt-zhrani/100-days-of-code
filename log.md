# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017 (DrumPGuitar Beats)

**Today's Progress**: I spent some time setting up my Git for Windows ssh keys. As for the small app(Drum Beats), I added HTML elements for main key boxes and some CSS styling, followed a tutorial to understand handling key events using valnilla JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I feel that I still need to fix the CSS part. I have spent few hours although I am supposed to stick to my rule -One hour a day- ;-)

**Link to work:** to be added tomorrow.


### Day 2: January 04, 2017 (DrumPGuitar Beats)

**Today's Progress**: Added keys for piano and guitar sounds to the existing HTML. Also customized some CSS styling to separate different types of keys, added events handling using JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow, I will start building an e-commerce website using Spring Boot with Java for the backend.

### Day 3: January 05, 2017 (Registration and Login Project)

**Today's Progress**: practiced building a simple MVC project (in preparation for building an e-commerce website) that handles registration and login; Created a registration model and view.

**Thoughts:** I struggled with binding object reference with the view part of the project (JSP and Spring in Java). Turned out that Spring cannot map String values from the view to object reference in the model. Needed to use converter service interface using Spring. Solved!!

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on Task Tracker. designed layout of the UI and successfully figured out how to display tasks stored in the DB using JSTL markups.
**Thoughts:** One thing is that Intellij IDEA integration with Github has not been pleasant for me. It keeps referring to an old Github account that I don't use anymore. So I quit using IDEA built-in API and started using Git command line. Much better.
