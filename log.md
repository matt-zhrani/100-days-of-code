# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 03, 2017 (DrumPGuitar Beats)

**Today's Progress**: I spent some time setting up my Git for Windows ssh keys. As for the small app(Drum Beats), I added HTML elements for main key boxes and some CSS styling, followed a tutorial to understand handling key events using valnilla JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I feel that I still need to fix the CSS part. I have spent few hours although I am supposed to stick to my rule -One hour a day- ;-)

**Link to work:** to be added tomorrow.



### Day 2: January 04, 2017 (DrumPGuitar Beats)

**Today's Progress**: Added keys for piano and guitar sounds to the existing HTML. Also customized some CSS styling to seperate diferent types of keys, added events handling using JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Tomorrow, I will start building an e-commerse website using Spring Boot with Java for the backend.
