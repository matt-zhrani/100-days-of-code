# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 30, 2016 (Drum Beats)

**Today's Progress**: I spent some time setting up my Git for Windows ssh keys. As for the small app(Drum Beats), I added HTML elements for main key boxes and some CSS styling, followed a tutorial to understand handling key events using valnilla JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** I feel that I still need to fix the CSS part. I have spent few hours although I am supposed to stick to my rule -One hour a day- ;-)

**Link to work:** to be added tomorrow.
